Next:
1. Randomize shapes
2. Limit colors
3. Add a start button
4. Create a border of grey blocks
5. Fine tune landing mechanisms, when next to other square, it can't shift the other pieces
6. (Optional) Create grid so that pieces can't just move horizontally centimeters off, a grid would ensure that moving the pieces on the x axis (horizontally) would "lock into place", so each piece in a column is aligned horizontally
7. There needs to be rules for when you do well, the columns stacks disappear, so that the stacks don't just build up and you lose the game every time
